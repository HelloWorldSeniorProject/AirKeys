3.4                 The system shall be able to read individual values from the configuration state 

3.5                 The system shall maintain an 'inactive state' during diagnostic/calibration     
                    tasks.                                                                          

3.6                 The system shall not send any keystoke data to connected device when in a       
                    non-active state.                                                               

4.1                 The system should detect keystokes with 85% accuracy.                           

5.1                 The system shall send user input to connected system within 1 second from       
                    physical keystoke.                                                              

6.1                 The system shall use the last set connection settings on power cycle.           

8.2                 The system shall be capable of displaying an image upon startup without any user
                    input.                                                                          

13.2                The system shall be capable of writing data to files in jpeg or png format.

15.1                The system shall keep a record of any event that results in an error due to file
                    management. These events shall be considered 'critical'.                        

15.2                The system shall keep a record of any error that will cause the software to     
                    crash or operate at partial functionality. These errors shall be considered     
                    'critical'.                                                                     

16.2                The system shall be capable of sending a keyboard interrupt to devices with     
                    Windows-based operating systems, Unix-based operating systems, Android operating
                    system, and IOS.                                                                

17.1                The system shall enter a 'calibration' state upon startup and every change of   
                    keyboard layout.                                                                

17.2                The system shall detect at least 4,3-dimensional edges of projection to create  
                    an acceptable border of vision.                                                 

17.3                The system shall only use data within the 3-dimensional border of vision.
