1.1                 The system shall 'pair' with other devices within 15 seconds.                   

2.3                 The system shall record the time when a key is pressed using the internal clock.

3.5                 The system shall maintain an 'inactive state' during diagnostic/calibration     
                    tasks.                                                                          

3.6                 The system shall not send any keystoke data to connected device when in a       
                    non-active state.                                                               

4.1                 The system should detect keystokes with 85% accuracy.                           

5.1                 The system shall send user input to connected system within 1 second from       
                    physical keystoke.                                                              

6.1                 The system shall use the last set connection settings on power cycle.           

14.1                The system shall be capable of capturing live image (frame) data.               

14.2                The system shall be capable of combining frame data from at least 2 synchronized
                    sources.                                                                        

14.3                The system shall capture a minimum of 20 frames per second per source.          

16.2                The system shall be capable of sending a keyboard interrupt to devices with     
                    Windows-based operating systems, Unix-based operating systems, Android operating
                    system, and IOS.                                                                

17.1                The system shall enter a 'calibration' state upon startup and every change of   
                    keyboard layout.                                                                

17.2                The system shall detect at least 4,3-dimensional edges of projection to create  
                    an acceptable border of vision.                                                 

17.3                The system shall only use data within the 3-dimensional border of vision.
