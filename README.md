## Overview

The Adjustable Image Recognition Keyboard System (AirKeys) is a proof-of-concept virtual keyboard designed to
support multiple languages, keyboard layouts, sizes, and operating systems. By combining image processing
with modern hardware, we aim to explore the feasibility of creating a primarily virtual typing experience.

The project has been completed by 4 Computer Science/Software Engineering students at Florida Institute of Technology:

    Malakai Spann   : Technical Lead (Product) / Team Lead / Developer
    Minho Son       : Technical Lead (Data Processing) / Developer
    Anwuli Ajabor   : Lead Developer (User Interface)
    Kyle Stewart    : Developer (Data Stream)

under the supervision of Dr. Marius Silaghi.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to design, develop, and test a virtual keyboard. The project serves as the development teams' capstone project for their undergraduate degree. 

The original team began development in January 2023 and ended in December 2023. **The product is not completed**.
